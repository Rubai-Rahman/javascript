//  JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.

// Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

// Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or close the window.

// Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.
//A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
